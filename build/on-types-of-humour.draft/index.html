   Low-effort sarcasm, i.e., when equated with verbal irony (meaning literal opposite of what is said), or when someone is just being a dick, is the lowest form of wit for sure. But otherwise...

Irony is more recognized than deployed. Its found in situations and scenarios. A situation becomes funny because you recognize that something happens in it which is opposite of what is expected of it.

Of course, irony can be deployed in writing or speaking. But it still is deployed to describe a situation where something opposite of what you would expect happens. For example, Bill Hillmann, the author of multiple books about how to not get gored by bulls was the only non-Spaniard to get gored in the 2014 running of the bulls in Pamplona.

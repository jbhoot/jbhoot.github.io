Spectrum: Gullibulism? | Optimism | Scepticism | Cynicism | Apathy?

Realism?

Only scepticism relates to critical thinking. Rest are all either sunny and rosy, or clouds and lightning.

Wrt short-term thinking or decision-making and not wanting to apply critical thinking because its work, choosing Gullibulism (e.g., Modiji/Gurudev keh rahe hai to sahi hi hoga) or Cynicism/Apathy (e.g., rationalizing not helping out someone) is the easiest. So people often stick to these two in different walks of life. This makes me sound like a cynic now.

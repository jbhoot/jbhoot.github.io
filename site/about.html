<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Jayesh, but my friends often call me by my last name <i>Bhoot</i>, because <i>Bhoot</i> means <i>Ghost</i> in several Indian languages. According to these same <i>friends</i>,
  <a href="#how-i-look-like">my countenance ↓</a> stays true to my last name.</p>

<p>I live with my partner in a hilly city. We have a dog and a cat...or the cat has me and my partner and the dog.</p>

<p>I am a polyglot software developer – polyglot in sense of technology domains, business domains, as well as programming languages.</p>

<p>I am a Southpaw. I recently bought a pair of left-handed scissors. Now I know – after 35 years of my existence on Earth – what a smooth and elegant cutting feels like.</p>

<h2>How I look like </h2>

<h2>About this website</h2>

<p>This website is built with <a href="https://soupault.app">soupault</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://baturin.org">Danil Baturin</a> for building this fantastic tool, and to
  <a href="https://github.com/aantron/">Anton Bachin</a> for building <a href="https://github.com/aantron/lambdasoup">lambdasoup</a>, the scraping library that powers soupault.</p>

<p>I write the content of this website in HTML and, sometimes, Markdown. I am leaning towards using just HTML though.</p>

<h3>Styling</h3>

<p>I style this website using the principles espoused in <a href="">Every Layout</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Global layer: aesthetics (fonts, colors, shadows, etc.)</li>
  <li>Layout layer: Every Layout patterns for layout and arrangement of boxes</li>
  <li>Specifics layer: which uses utility classes. Tailwind could be used in this layer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Much of the styling gets accomplished in layer 1 and 2. CSS custom properties a.k.a. CSS variables are used to make the layout layer, i.e., layer 2, configurable.</p>

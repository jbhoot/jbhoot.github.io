<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Jayesh, but my friends often call me by my last name <i>Bhoot</i>, because <i>Bhoot</i> means <i>Ghost</i> in several Indian languages. According to these same <i>friends</i>,
  <a href="#how-i-look-like">my countenance ↓</a> stays true to my last name.</p>

<p>I live with my partner in a hilly city. A cat and a dog live in our house. Or we live in theirs. The ownership is becoming murky.</p>

<p>I am a polyglot software developer – polyglot in sense of technology domains, business domains, as well as programming languages.</p>

<p>I am a Southpaw. I recently bought a pair of left-handed scissors. Now I know – after 35 years of my existence on Earth – what a smooth and elegant cutting feels like.</p>

<figcaption>This is what Jayesh Bhoot looks like. The picture was taken at the <i>Seamouth Beach</i> near <i>Chilika Lake</i> in Odisha. The backdrop is basically the Bay of Bengal. 35 years spent on Earth, and I'm still unsure how to smile and pose in front of a camera.</figcaption>

<p>In the OCaml ecosystem, opam is the most popular package management tool, while dune is the foremost build tool.</p>

<p>Both have evolved independently. While they manage to work in tandem, there are a lot of irregularities to trip on
where they meet.</p>

<h2>Local switch in opam</h2>

<p>opam's local switch feature can set up and isolate development environment and dependencies per project.</p>

<p><code>opam switch create</code> creates a local switch if it is given the path to a directory. If the specified
directory does not exist, then its is created.</p>

<pre><code>opam switch create ./path/to/existing/dir</code></pre>

<p>The above command creates an <i>_opam</i> directory inside the given path, inside which all of the opam-related
artifacts for this project are stored.</p>

<p>A cool side-effect is that when a directory containing a local opam switch is visited, that switch is activated
automatically. No need to <code>opam switch set</code> the switch explicitly.</p>

<h2>dune init project</h2>

<p><code>dune init project</code> is the recommended way to bootstrap an OCaml project.</p>

<pre><code>dune init project prj_name</code></pre>

<p> The above command creates a directory named <i>prj_name</i> in the current directory, and populates it with project
artifacts.</p>

<p>I found that dune cannot bootstrap a project in the current directory itself. So <code>dune init project .</code>
fails to work.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p> I prefer to use opam's local switch feature to ensure the isolatation of all dependencies and tools related to an
OCaml project. This means I also prefer to install dune per-project. So </p>

<ol>
<li>I want to use dune to bootstrap a project</li>
<li>dune is installed through opam</li>
<li>opam needs a local switch for per-project installation</li>
<li>A local switch needs an existing empty project directory</li>
<li>dune cannot bootstrap a project in a current directory</li>
</ol>

<p>The chicken and egg problem looks easy now, huh?</p>

<p>I started guessing a solution. </p>

<hgroup>
<h3>Attempt 1</h3>
<p>Execute opam and dune commands from parent directory</p>
</hgroup>

<p>I planned the following idealised sequence of commands:</p>

<pre><code># create an empty project dir
~/projects $ mkdir my_prj

# create a local switch
~/projects $ opam switch create ./my_prj

# install dune in our local switch
~/projects $ opam install dune

# bootstrap project
~/projects $ dune init project my_prj</code></pre>

<p>I didn't make it past the 3rd command of installing dune because of the following (reasonable) error:</p>

<pre><code>$ opam install dune
[ERROR] No switch is currently set. Please use 'opam switch'
to set or install a switch.</code></pre>

<p>Ok, then. I tried to set the switch after creating it.</p>

<pre><code>~/projects $ mkdir my_prj
~/projects $ opam switch create ./my_prj
~/projects $ opam switch set ./my_prj
[ERROR] Can not set external switch '/Users/jb/projects/my_prj' globally. To set
it in the current shell use:
eval $(opam env --switch=/Users/jb/projects/my_prj --set-switch)</code></pre>

<p>The advice felt like a long-winded solution to me. I wanted a simpler solution.</p>

<p>So may be, first, I should enter the empty project directory to set up the project.</p>

<hgroup>
<h3>Attempt 2</h3>
<p>Execute opam and dune commands from project directory</p>
</hgroup>

<p>I carried out the following sequence of commands:</p>

<pre><code>~/projects $ mkdir my_prj
~/projects $ cd my_prj 
~/projects/my_prj $ opam switch create . 
~/projects/my_prj $ opam install dune
~/projects/my_prj $ dune init project my_prj</code></pre>

<p>The above sequence creates a <code>my_prj/my_prj/</code> directory tree. That's not what I wanted.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<hgroup>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>exploit opam's auto-activation of local switch</p>
</hgroup>

<p>Now, consider the following sequence of commands:</p>

<pre><code># create an empty project dir
~/projects $ mkdir my_prj

~/projects $ cd my_prj 

# create a local switch, which is auto-activated after a successful creation
# because the switch is created in the current directory itself.
~/projects/my_prj $ opam switch create . 

~/projects/my_prj $ opam install dune

# go back to parent, with opam still pointing to the local switch env
# until the current session ends or until another switch is activated
~/projects $ cd .. 

# bootstrap our project
~/projects/my_prj $ dune init project my_prj</code></pre>

<p>Note the 3rd command <code>opam switch create .</code>. After the command finishes execution, the switch is
auto-activated because the local switch lives in the current directory <code>.</code> itself.</p>

<p>opam also sets an env var <code>OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX</code> to the path of this activated switch.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo $OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX 
/Users/jb/projects/my_prj/_opam</code></pre>

<p>This env var probably lives on until the current shell session ends even if the directory changes, or until another
switch is activated.</p>

<aside>
<p>If the directory is changed at this point, then <code>opam switch list</code> no longer shows an active switch.
However, <code>OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX</code> still points to our my_prj local switch until a directory with another local
switch is visited.</p>

<p>Also, my machine's opam setup does not a global switch at all. I am not sure how opam would behave amidst all of this
in presence of a global switch. A case for another time, may be.</p>
</aside>

<p>That means that when the above command sequence goes one directory up to execute <code>dune init project</code>, opam
is still pointing to the right local switch env.</p>

<p>Also dune does not mind if the directory <i>my_prj</i> already exists.</p>

<p>Case solved!</p>

<p>I can imagine a variation of the above sequence:</p>

<pre><code># create an empty project dir
~/projects $ mkdir my_prj

# create our local switch
~/projects $ opam switch create ./my_prj 

# activate our local switch
~/projects $ cd my_prj 

# go back to parent, with opam still pointing to the local switch env
# until the current session ends or until another switch is activated
~/projects/my_prj $ cd .. 

# install dune in our local switch
~/projects $ opam install dune

# bootstrap our project
~/projects $ dune init project my_prj</code></pre>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>There is <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/extending-dune-with-package-management/5649">work under progress</a> to
wrap dune around opam, thus making dune as the unifying package management and build solution.</p>

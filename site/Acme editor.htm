mkdir -p ~/mnt/font  # because I have no clue where fontsrv mounts font dir by default
9 fontsrv -m ~/mnt/font
9 acme -f ~/mnt/font/ClearSans/24a/font -F ~/mnt/font/Menlo-Regular/24a/font

9p ls font does not really work on NixOS + plan9port at least.

plan9port works well with FUSE.
It works less well with the 9p module.

Assuming you have write permission on /mnt/acme
and FUSE installed,

acme -m /mnt/acme

should work just fine.

Another way is to set $font env var:

$font=~/mnt/font/ClearSans/24a/font 9 acme

However, we can't seem to configure proportional and monospaced fonts this way.

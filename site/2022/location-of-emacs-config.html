<h1>Location of emacs config</h1>

<p class="e-summary">After a fresh emacs installation, I always spent a few minutes why emacs wouldn't pick up my config from <code>~/.config/emacs/init.el</code>.</p>

<div class="e-content">

<p>I prefer to keep user configuration inside the standard <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, which typically points to <code>~/.config/</code>. Emacs also supports <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, but as the <em>last</em> entry in its list of preferred locations, where it looks for <code>init.el</code>.</p>

<p>The list goes in the order: <code>~/.emacs.el</code>, <code>~/.emacs</code>, or <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, and <em>then</em> <code>~/.config/emacs/init.el</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Find-Init.html">Emacs manual</a> also says the following:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Find-Init.html">
<p>Note also that if neither the XDG location nor <code>~/.emacs.d</code> exist, then Emacs will create <code>~/.emacs.d</code> (and therefore use it during subsequent invocations).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the XDG location, i.e., <code>~/.config/emacs/</code> wouldn't typically exist in a system by default. So emacs would always end up defaulting to <code>~/.emacs.d/</code>. In order to make it read the XDG location, I always had to manually delete <code>~/.emacs.d/</code> first.</p>

<p>So much hassle on every new system or after a fresh emacs installation. So I now just <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/"><code>stow</code></a> my emacs dotfiles to <code>~/.emacs.d</code>.</p>

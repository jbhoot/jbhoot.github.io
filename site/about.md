# About Jayesh Bhoot

![Profile picture](/profile-pic.jpg)

<p>Hi, I am Jayesh, but my friends often call me by my last name <i>Bhoot</i>, because <i>Bhoot</i> means <i>Ghost</i> in several Indian languages.</p>

<p>I am a polyglot software developer – polyglot in sense of technology domains, business domains, as well as programming languages.</p>

<p>I am a Southpaw. I recently bought a pair of left-handed scissors. Now I know – after 35 years of my existence on Earth – what a smooth and elegant cutting feels like.</p>

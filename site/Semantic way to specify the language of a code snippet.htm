As a habit, I used to just wrap a code fragment in a <pre>.

However, HTML spec describes <pre> as:

The pre tag represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements.

So, a pre can contain anything which conveys its semantic meaning at least partly through how its text is formatted, like a code snippet, a poem, or an ascii art.

How do we distinguish a code snippet then? By wrapping the snippet in a code tag, and then wrapping it in a pre tag.

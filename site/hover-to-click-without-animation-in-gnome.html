    Desktop systems usually provide an accessibility feature, with which a user only has to hover the cursor
    over where he wants to click. The click goes off automatically. In GNOME, this feature is called <i>Hover
        Click</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Not having to press the mouse button makes for a much more pleasurable and efficient experience. Coupled
    with <i>Sticky Keys</i>, <i>Hover Click</i> has also helped me recover from a hand injury.

<p>
    The click goes off a few configurable milliseconds after the user positions the cursor. GNOME represents
    this buffer with an animating circle, which looks pretty but gets in the way, especially if you are trying
    to course-correct the cursor position.

<p>
    The option to disable this animation is simple but not straightforward. You need to disable all the
    animations entirely from Gnome Tweaks:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open <i>Gnome Tweaks</i> tool</li>
    <li>Open <i>General</i> Tab</li>
    <li>Turn <i>Animations</i> off</li>
</ol>

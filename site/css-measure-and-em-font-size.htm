Example problem:

* {
max-inline-size: var(--measure);
}

You would want caption size to be smaller than the rest of the body text.
It should also employ the measure width.

figcaption,
caption {
font-size: 0.8em;
border: 1px solid black;
}

But the border around the caption will be shorter in width than the rest of the text, because of the font-size 0.8em;.

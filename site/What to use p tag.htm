p tag holds a run of phrasing content

p is to other elements that can contain phrasing content, what section is to other grouping elements. While they still represent semantics, the latter should always be preferred wherever possible.

<aside>span is to other text-level elements what div is to other grouping elements. They provide <em> no </em> semantic meaning whatsoever, and should be used for <em> styling purposes only </em>. </aside>

<aside> Prefer div to section if the purpose is stylistic sectioning. </aside>

I would use a p within an element that hosts flow content, in which a run of phrasing content should be slightly separated / distinguished from other such runs, but where the better siblings of p are not applicable.

e.g.,
<figcaption> A single run of phrasing content </figcaption>

may not need a p tag, but

<figcaption>
    <p> Cats are classified as feline. </p>
    <p> Dogs come under canine. </p>
</figcaption>

may be better served with p tags.

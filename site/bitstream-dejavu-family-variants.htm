BitStream Vera Sans Mono: original ancestor of the family
DejaVu Sans Mono: underscore is too low and thin, almost invisible in macOS Terminal; hyphen is too short
Menlo / Meslo: improves DejaVu directly (underscore, hyphen, darkened dot colon)
Hack: improves DejaVu (underscore, hyphen, round dot, colon etc.)
Droid Sans Mono: derived from DejaVu, but hyphen and greater-than sign are not aligned, arrow -> looks wonky; has straight bar as tail on l; better t compared to DejaVu
Droid Sans Mono SW: improves Droid Sans Mono (fixes wonky arrow, good underscore); has curvy tail on l
Liberation Mono; Roboto Mono
CommitMono
Inconsolata: wonky t

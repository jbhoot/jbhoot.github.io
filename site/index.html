    Hi, I'm Jayesh, but my friends often call me by my last name <i>Bhoot</i>,
    because <i>Bhoot</i> means <i>Ghost</i> in several Indian languages.
  </p>
  <p>I live with my partner in a hilly city. A cat and a dog live in our house. Or we live in theirs. The ownership is becoming murky.</p>
  <p>
    I am a polyglot software developer – polyglot in sense of technology
    domains, business domains, as well as programming languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a Southpaw. I recently bought a pair of left-handed scissors. Now I
    know – after 35 years of my existence on Earth – what a smooth and elegant
    cutting feels like.
  </p>
  <p>I am a bookworm. I mainly read fiction. Currently I am reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212276037-the-devils"><i>The Devils</i></a> by <i>Joe Abercrombie</i>.</p>
  <!-- <p>I try to keep learning new skills. I learned to drive a car at the beginning of this year. Currently, I am learning to swim freestyle. I am now able to swim between 6 and 8 laps, 25 metres each, while stopping briefly after each lap, but without going out of breath in the midst of a lap.</p> -->

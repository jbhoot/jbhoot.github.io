    Hi, I'm Jayesh, but my friends often call me by my last name <i>Bhoot</i>,
    because <i>Bhoot</i> means <i>Ghost</i> in several Indian languages.

    I am a polyglot software developer – polyglot in sense of technology
    domains, business domains, as well as programming languages.

    I am a Southpaw. I recently bought a pair of left-handed scissors. Now I
    know – after 35 years of my existence on Earth – what a smooth and elegant
    cutting feels like.

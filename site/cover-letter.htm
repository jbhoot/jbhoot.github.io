<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

<p>I have come to prefer programming platforms with a robust type system, like, ReScript, ReasonML, OCaml, Scala. Adding to that my long experience in full-stack web development, I think my interest and skillset aligns very well with your open position of ReasonML Developer at Ahrefs.</p>

<p>Below, I will try to justify my suitability with regard to your basic expectations.</p>

<h2>Experience in ReasonML and likes</h2>

<p>In my recent work and personal projects, I</p>
<ul>
<li>designed and implemented frontend of an insurance product in React and ReScript, with RxJS for state management</li>
<li>implemented a CLI application in OCaml to process climate data. It uses libraries like Lwt, cohttp, ptime, caqti, and yojson.</li>
<li>wrote a utility in F# to scrape data from a soon-to-be-shutdown website</li>
<li>wrote and published two <a href="https://github.com/jyssh/pin-unpin-tab">Firefox</a> <a href="https://github.com/jyssh/enforce-browser-fonts">WebExtensions</a> in OCaml</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, and design mock-up translations</h2>
<p>About half of my work experience has been in developing web frontend code, most of it using React or React-like libraries.</p>
<p>My typical approach to implement a component is to implement:</p>
<ol>
<li>write semantic HTML for the component</li>
<li>implement associated features to make the component functional</li>
<li>implement styling</li>
</ol>
<p>I have also designed mock-ups in Figma, and translated them into HTML + React + CSS code.</p>

<h2>Cross-browser and cross-platform testing</h2>
<p>I prefer to test code that run in browser, in a real browser, instead of a simulated DOM environment. To that effect, I have used WebdriverIO to run unit, integration and E2E tests across browsers and platforms.</p>

<h2>Understand business needs and user behaviour, and propose UI/UX improvement</h2>
<p>As a freelance developer, I am used to help my clients shape and simplify business and domain needs.</p>
<p>I persuaded a client to convert a confusing 3-action workflow into simpler, 2-step workflow, with only some changes in language.</p>
<p>I have designed wizards to simplify input workflow for users, ensuring to group only relevant inputs together in a wizard step.</p>

<h2>Work independently</h2>
<p>Being able to work independently is an integral trait in a developer like me who has spent most of his career working remotely as a freelancer.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to working with you.</p>

autocomplete

better editing than the pesky GNU readline
    . inconsistent keybindings - alt-b / alt-f dont work on macOS without work, and then still dont work often


terminal = shell (bash, zsh) + terminal emulator
Emacs's shell, eshell is a shell like bash/zsh
Vim's terminal mode is a terminal emulator which sends inputs to a bg terminal?, and prints output from there. Emacs's term, ansi-term, vterm also does the same. So lag involved in heavy processing.

Solutions
. ctrl-x ctrl-e to edit command in editor is ok, but no autocomplete there
. vi mode of the shell: inconsistent, doesnt alleviate all problems of GNU readline
. 2nd lvl: terminal emulator in vim. Gives us all - editing motions, autocomplete, history, all of it
. 3rd lvl: edit with all features of vim emulator, plus send to REPL. Probably possible only in a language with a decent stdlib (+ libraries), and strong REPL support. So clojure? But it cannot list libraries dependencies in same file. Common lisp?

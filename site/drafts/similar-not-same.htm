    # In computer science, an escape sequence is a combination of characters that has a meaning other than the literal characters contained therein.
    # It is marked by one or more preceding (and possibly terminating) characters
    # Syntax of colour code escape sequence: \033[code1;code2;codeNm where
    # \033[ indicates the beginning of an escape sequence. \033 is the octal value of ESC ASCII character. \e is the equivalent of \033 in bindkey. \033 is the most standard.
    # code1;code2;codeN specifies a series of numbers, which indicate either of:
    #   font style (00 -> normal; 01 -> bold; 04 -> underlined; 05 -> blinking)
    #   foreground colour code. An fg colour code starts with 4. eg., 32 is green.
    #   background colour code. A bg colour code starts with 4. eg., 42 is green.
    # m indicates that the sequence is a colour code?
    # eg., \033[01;04;37;42m formats the subsequent text as bold + underlined + white fg + green bg.

    # Always make sure to reset the colour sequence with \033[00m

    # When to put square brackets around escape sequences?
    # First, bash doesn't define colors. In fact bash has absolutely no idea that colors even exist.
    # All it knows is that you told it to output the characters \033[0;36m.
    # Your terminal emulator (xterm, gnome-terminal, whatever) receives these characters and understands "I need to start outputting in cyan".
    # Now back to bash. As you may have noticed, when I've been referring to the cyan color, I've been using \033[0;36m, not \[\033[0;36m\].
    # The square brackets have been missing. The purpose of the square brackets is that when using escape codes (colors) in the prompt,
    # bash has to know which characters are non-printing (zero-width, don't actually show anything).
    # Thus you enclose non-printing characters in \[ \].
    # If you remove these characters, everything might appear to work just fine at first,
    # but you'll start running into all sorts of weirdness when your command exceeds the terminal width.
    # Square brackets are usually only relevant in the prompt.

# While PS1 is a bash-only variable, a subshell like bash-acting-as-sh spawned with `sudo su` seems to use PS1 definition.
# In this case, as the shell is acting as sh, it won't read .bashrc, and fail to find the `prompt` function with the error:
# > `sh: prompt: command not found`
# Note that bash subshells will read ~/.bashrc and so use this PS1 definition anyway. eg., bash shell spawned by `nix develop`

compares arbitrage funds to debt funds.

[^2]: As their name suggests, conservative hybrid funds are more tilted towards debt. The debt component in their
portfolios can be 75â€“90 per cent, with the remaining in equity. These funds are suitable for retirees who may want a
significant portion of their portfolio in debt, with some equity component for inflation adjustment.

[^3]: Aggressive hybrid are not much different from flexi-cap (full equity). Ideally, conservative/balanced hybrid +
flexi-cap would provide more diversification than aggressive hybrid + flexi-cap.

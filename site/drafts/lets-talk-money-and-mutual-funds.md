compares arbitrage funds to debt funds.

[^2]: As their name suggests, conservative hybrid funds are more tilted towards debt. The debt component in their
portfolios can be 75â€“90 per cent, with the remaining in equity. These funds are suitable for retirees who may want a
significant portion of their portfolio in debt, with some equity component for inflation adjustment.

[^3]: Aggressive hybrid are not much different from flexi-cap (full equity). Ideally, conservative/balanced hybrid +
flexi-cap would provide more diversification than aggressive hybrid + flexi-cap.

## My approach

Let's try to classify these recommendations into categories between which *a gulf* of risk and returns exist.

- low to moderately low: liquid fund, money market fund, banking and PSU fund, arbitrage fund, ultra-short term/duration
- moderate to moderately high: conservative hybrid, balanced hybrid, dynamic asset allocation, aggressive hybrid
- high to very high: flexi-cap equity, index fund, multi-cap, individual stocks

Within each category, I wish to keep only 2 types, ideally the lowest risk and the middle ground:

- liquid fund, money market fund, (*may be* arbitrage fund as the tax-efficient alternative to the other two)
- conservative hybrid, dynamic asset allocation
- flexi-cap equity, index fund, multi-cap, individual stocks

Also, as an investment horizon closes in, its important to be able to STP an invested goal from original scheme to a
safer one *within the same fund house*.

e.g., Parag Parikh AMC has a nice STP routes to achieve this, but without a money market fund:

- PPDAAF -> PPCHF -> PPLF
- PPFCF -> PPCHF -> PPLF

## Tax treatment of hybrid funds

Arbitrage fund is treated like equity funds are. But conservative hybrid funds (at least funds like PPCHF where equity
allocation is less than 35%) are taxed like debt funds are (at slab level).

A fund like PPDAAF may be treated like an equity fund. But verify it first.

In short, do not choose a CHF thinking its more tax-efficient than a debt fund.

### What's with the weird setup for emergency fund?

The emergency cash (= instant) part of the fund is fulfilled with FD.

In theory, emergency fund is to be held indefinitely. So it has indefinite time horizon, low risk, and high liquidity.
So why not earn some higher returns safely? Hence, either money market fund or arbitrage fund instead of liquid fund.

Arbitrage fund is more tax-efficient than money market fund as it is taxed like an equity fund instead of a debt fund.

I will keep an eye on its returns for a year or two, as MMF is supposed to be more consistent in its returns. On the
other hand, PPAF's manager has moved his emergency fund from liquid fund to arbitrage fund. So let's see how it goes.

### Uncertainty about arbitrage fund

What arbitrage funds gain in taxes, gives away in terms of volatility.

Arbitrage funds are unsuited for long-term investment as the returns may be similar to a liquid fund pre-tax. Also,
*arbitrage opportunities have considerably decreased* in the Indian markets due to greater participation. Such funds can
be used short-term but with no great return expectation. [..] In summary, never choose a more volatile product only
because it is taxed less! Arbitrage funds can be used as a tax-efficient short-term alternative to debt funds.[^1]

Note that some (many?) liquid funds have an instant redemption option (within certain limits), whereas **redemption from
arbitrage funds will take a few days to materialize**. So you shouldn't keep your level 1 emergency money in arbitrage
funds; your savings bank account is better for that purpose.

While it works well for a horizon of 6 months to 1 year, I am not sure how arbitrage fund would behave post 1 year.

### Why not ultra-short duration or low duration funds?

UST Funds engage in more risky investments in an attempt to outperform Money Market Funds.

Unlike other short-duration funds (such as ultra-short / low duration funds), money market funds do not hold lower-rated
debt to push up yields.

### Why not banking and PSU fund?

Money market fund is the best middle ground within this category w.r.t. risks and returns.

### Why not balanced hybrid fund?

I want to use them, but they are nowhere to be found in the India's mutual fund market.

### TO-DO

Make decisions in the following only after reading *Let's Talk Mutual Funds* in full.

- Do flexi-cap and index fund overlap? OR Should I invest in index fund when I already have flexi-cap?
- Should I invest in small and multi-cap in form of individual stocks using value-based investing?
- Should I invest in multi-cap when I already have flexi-cap?
- Should I invest in multi-asset when I already have flexi-cap?
- How do I account for gold and REIT investments? Do multi-asset include them? Check out Quantum's multi-asset fund.

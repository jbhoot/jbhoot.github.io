<h1>Honeypot input and other captcha alternatives</h1>

<p>Problem with keeping a honeypot field with type=text or similar (email, etc.) is that browser autofills will fill the input when a user autofills the form.</p>

<p>Keep a honeypot field as generic and simple as possible. The more shenanigans added to it, like hidden, aria-hidden, positioning, the more a smarter bot is likely to identify it as a honeypot field.</p>

<p>What's the point of hiding a honeypot input anyway?</p>

Save - goals for which you want to parallely allocate to
  - Retirement
  - Far-off goals: House, children education fund, etc.
  - Emergency (unemployment, medical emergency that couldn't be covered under a cashless mediclaim, sudden unavoidable liabilities like tax payment?)
  - Goals for which you spend if you already have the targeted amount, or when you reach the targeted amount (wait for money to gather), one at a time: chimney, car, dishwasher, etc.
  - Goals for which you spend when you reach the targeted time. Sort of an ever-filling fund: Holiday/vacation (= anything that includes costs of travel + accommodation + food + shopping); Also include trips to home (= travel + shopping + food)
Repay
  EMIs: save-then-spend is almost always better than spend-then-pay-emi. The former is also better to keep the EMIs within 20% of total income. Otherwise, EMIs will consume most of the income. Higher the amount that goes into EMI, lower the amount that goes into savings.

Allocate (Sum(Assets) - Sum(Liabilities)) in the following order:
1. Save: retirement + emergency (15%?)
2. Repay: EMIs
3. Spend: needs
4. Repay: non-EMI debts
5. Save: short-term, travel, holiday, retirement, depending on where its needed more
6. Spend: wants

---

Match the lower of the two salaries and live off that: 68k * 2 = 136k
From this, cover:
1. Save: retirement + emergency (15%?)
2. Repay: EMIs
3. Spend: needs
4. Repay: non-EMI debts
5. Save: short-term, travel, holiday, retirement, depending on where its needed more
6. Spend: wants

Then put the excess of my income into:
1. Save
   - retirement
   - emergency (15%?)
4. Repay: essential, large non-EMI debts
   - (e.g., Jayesh's tax payment which anyway should be paid from my own income)
5. Save
   - short-term goal
   - holiday/travel

(- 136000 ; income = 68k * 2
(+ 13600  ; save: retirement : 10% of income (should've been 15%)
   35000  ; repay: emi: home emi + home insurance emi
   10000  ; repay: emi: dyson emi
   13600  ; save: 10% of income to goals-based savings
   8500   ; spend: fixed
   55300  ; spend: variable
   ))

Above split reinforces the rule: higher the amount goes into EMIs, lower the amount goes into savings.

Accounts required for above approach: 

- 2 Income a/c total, one for each
- Save
  - 1 Emergency savings a/c
  - 1 short-goals savings a/c
  - 1 travel fund savings a/c
  - diversified retirement a/cs
- Repay, Spend
  - 2 expense a/c in total, one for each

Expense accounts:
Expense/Fixed
Expense/Variable
Expense/ShortGoals/*
Expense/Trip/*
Expense/Emergency/*


Types of accounts
Angle 1: What to do with the money in an account?
  Income, Spending, Save - Emergency, Save - ShortGoals, Save - Holiday
Angle 2: 
  Asset, Liability, Equity, Income, Expense

There is a/c, then there is fund. For example, Holiday a/c, in which the money allocated so far to the holiday fund is parked

Tax payment is probably a liability. Its sudden payment should be paid from emeregency account instead of worrying about having to keep an approx amount aside all the time.

Expense accounts - Sbi9883, Sbi4854, InHand, Sbi2112, Sbi9436 are actually outflow accounts more than monthly-expense accounts. So, for example, cash in InHand shouldn't just count against the monthly budget. Basically, we cannot just cleanly map a bank a/c to its purpose, unless we make all of them outflow or outgoing accounts. e.g., holiday expenses should flow from hdfc2091 directly. This is not practical all the time, because two people - Jayesh and Chhavi - spend during a holiday.

--------------

Our expenses can be seen as purchase of goods and services.
Some purchases happen every month, which could be reliably categorised and allocated towards.
Some purchases are one-off, like maintenance stuff, which usually also involve an unpredictable, non-trivial expense. For example, washing machine maintenance, plumbing maintenance, etc. These cannot be reliably categorised and allocated towards. Also, even if a reliable routine category exists, such an expense cannot be recorded against it. Otherwise it will disrupt the allocation to that category.
These should go in Expense/Small.
Unaccounted expenses should also go in Expense/Small.
I see potential for a category - one-off expenses for others which are not charity, for which we don't ask money back. For example, dad's insurance policy, dunzoed aayush's documents, etc.  Where should these go? Expense/Small, I think.

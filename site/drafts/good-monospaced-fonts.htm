TODO: Add criteria from workflowy

Monospaced Sans:
Liberation Mono, Roboto Mono
Consolas
Source Code Pro
Monaco
Second to last option: Droid Sans Mono, Droid Sans Mono SW: bit better than DejaVu group, but inconsistency still exists.
Last option: DejaVu Sans Mono, Menlo, Meslo, Mensch, Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, Hack: problem with this group is that while they are elegantly simple, the spacing between their characters is insonsistent. 'i' and 'f' in if look far away from each other. This inconsistency shows up starkly in a dense text or code block.
Fantasque Sans Mono

Monospaced Serif:
Latin Modern Mono, Courier, Courier New, Courier Prime, Final Draft Heavy, Courier Screenplay
PT Mono

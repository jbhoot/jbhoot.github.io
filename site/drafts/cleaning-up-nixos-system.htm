<h2> gc roots </h2>

nix-store --gc --print-roots

GC roots can be found in /nix/var/nix/gcroots.

<h2> Limit boot config </h2>

Limit boot configs (I set mine to 3).

<h2> Delete older generations </h2>

Delete old generations of system user
Delete old generations of personal user
Delete old generations of personal user
Delete old generations of home-manager

Simple

nix-collect-garbage -d

and 

sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

did not delete old generations for me, for whatever reason.

I had to explicitly delete old generations.

sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --list-generations
nix-env --list-generations
sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/jayesh/home-manager --list-generations
# also explore other profiles in /nix/var/nix/profiles/*

Delete old generations of a profile
sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --delete-generations old
nix-env --delete-generations old
sudo nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/jayesh/home-manager --delete-generations old

Now running

nix-collect-garbage -d
and
sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

gets rid of all older packages

sudo nix-env --list-generations is useless. It does not list system or root's generations!

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/how-to-get-rid-of-unused-home-manager-packages/14997/3 suggests the following to get rid of shell envs like per-project flakes (inside .direnv):

sudo -i nix-store --gc --print-roots | egrep -v '^(/nix/var|/run/current-system|/run/booted-system|/proc|{memory|{censored)'

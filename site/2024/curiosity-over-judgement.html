<p class="e-summary">I don't know about the cat, but curiosity certainly killed the judgmental!</p>

<div class="e-content">
  <p><i>Be curious, not judgmental.</i> I don't know who said it, but I heard it in the TV Show <i>Ted Lasso</i>. And boy, is it cathartic in its own way!</p>

  <p>Just being non-judgmental hasn't really worked for me in the past. I needed to replace it with something. Curiosity is a good replacement.</p>

  <p>As a pleasant side effect, this approach freed me from the pressure of being right or the fear of being wrong. If you are judging something or someone, you better be right about it. No such stress anymore!</p>

  <aside>Somewhat amusingly, this also got me to configure my <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enforce-browser-fonts/">Firefox add-on</a> to allow website-defined fonts by default. Earlier, I had it configured to force specific fonts.</aside>

Tip for Mutual Fund Utilities (MFU) users:

While transacting for a new folio, if you are stuck at "Nominee Verify" pop-up even after verifying the nominee(s), then check that:

1. Whether there are multiple holders of that CAN

2. Whether *all* of the holders have verified the nominee(s)

## The problem

I forgot to take screenshots, but here is a close enough description.

If none of the holders have verified the nominee details, then MFU's interface in this section provides a "Verify nominee" button *only* for the primary holder.

Once a primary holder has verified the nominee details, the interface looks like the verification is already complete. But New Folio transaction will still ask you to Verify Nominee. Very frustrating.

## The solution

In order for any holders to verify nominee details, use this link: [https://mfuonline.com/CNOMV](https://mfuonline.com/CNOMV)

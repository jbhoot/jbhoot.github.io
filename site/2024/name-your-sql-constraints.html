<h1>Name your SQL constraints</h1>

<div class="e-content">

<p>I learnt the hard way, while trying to amend the structure of a database instantiated at more than one place, that its best to explicitly name the SQL constraints like a foreign key.</p>

<p>Trying to adjust a foreign key constraint by referring it to its implicit name felt like holding on to a falling person just with their shoe. I could never be sure that the implicit name would be identical across different instances of the database.</p>

<p>Also, in MySQl at least, there was no foolproof way to dynamically query for the implicit name.</p>

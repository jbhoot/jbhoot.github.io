<p>I am going through the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/effective-scala">Effective Programming in Scala</a> on Coursera, and ran into build import errors in the very first assignment (fireworks).</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>While importing the fireworks project in VSCode-with-Metals, I encountered an error that started with:</p>

<pre><code>[..]bad constant pool index: [..]</code></pre>

<p>Looks like an error right out of a database connection pool library!</p>

<h2>Attempt 1</h2>

<p>One of the suggested solutions on Discord was to ensure that the versions of java, scala, and sbt exposed in the PATH are compatible with each other.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html">compatibility tables</a>.</p>

<p>But these were already compatible in my case.</p>

<h2>Attempt 2</h2>

<p>I roughly knew that *.sbt files describe the build of a project. Because the name bore relevance to build process, I also counted in a file I noticed in early debugging: <code>build.properties</code>.</p>

<p>So my first small scala project, and I am staring at the following list of *.sbt: </p>

<pre><code>zsh | ~/Downloads
$ tree -a -P "*.sbt" -P "*.properties" fireworks
fireworks
├── assignment.sbt
├── build.sbt
├── project
│   ├── build.properties
│   ├── buildSettings.sbt
│   └── plugins.sbt
└── src</code></pre>

<p>And all of them were staring back at me, daring me to find which one of them is hiding the cause of the error.</p>

<p>Anyway, enough drama.</p>

<p>On a hunch, I decided to match the versions of sbt and scala mentioned in these .sbt files with the ones exposed in the PATH.</p>

<p>The mismatch turned out to be in <code>build.properties</code>.</p>

<pre><code>zsh | ~/projects/effective-scala/week-1/fireworks
$ sbt -V
sbt version in this project: 1.9.9
sbt script version: 1.9.9

$ cat project/build.properties
sbt.version=1.8.2</code></pre>

<p>I matched the versions to be <code>1.9.9</code>, and re-ran the import. It worked.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the versions of java, scala, and sbt exposed in the PATH are compatible with each other. Use the official <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/jdk-compatibility/overview.html">compatibility tables</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure that the versions of sbt and scala exposed in the PATH match with the versions mentioned in the build files (like built.sbt, build.properties). Best make them identical.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope this was the correct solution.</p>

<p>As people who make tools to make people's lives easier, we sure love to torture ourselves with our own tools.</p>

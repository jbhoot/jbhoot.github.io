<h2>Update: 5 May 2024</h2>

<p>I have come crawling back to bash. Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>My interest in system, infrastructure, and developer tooling is growing. I don&apos;t see much place for a non-bash shell in that space. </li>
<li>I have time for only one niche ecosystem in my life. I have already chosen OCaml as it.</li>
<li>fish is too syntax-incompatible with bash, right down to inline declaration of env vars before executing a command. If I have to recall the fish syntax for every little thing, then it&apos;s just not worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Original article</h2>

<p>Here, I am putting down my reasons to choose <code>fish</code> shell for my future self.</p>

<p>All I want is a shell that is</p>

<ul>
<li>a first-class citizen on macOS and Linux</li>
<li>low maintenance, which means</li>
<li>out-of-the-box or low-configuration autocompletion and fuzzy history search</li>
<li>adequately supported by third-party tools</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't use shell much beyond that.</p>

<p>I also don't care much about scripting compabilities as I have never had to share scripts with others. Also, I prefer to write my scripts in typed, FP languages like Scala.</p>

<p><code>fish</code> checks all those boxes.</p>

<p><code>bash</code> is anything but first-class on macOS now.</p>

<p><code>zsh</code> is powerful, and comes with a lot of bells and whistles, most of them do not come out-of-the-box. I need to lug around a few packages (like <code>zsh-completions</code>) and a lot of configuration. I also need to maintain configuration for <code>fzf</code> for fuzzy search.</p>

<p>At the very least, I will stop worrying and wasting time in maintaining parity between bash and zsh configs.</p>

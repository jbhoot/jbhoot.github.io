<h1>Effective Scala, part 2 - domain modelling</h1>



<div class="e-content">


<p>Finding the <em>right</em> level of abstraction is more important than the best level of abstraction.</p>

<p>For example, in a problem involving doors and windows and facades, if the domain is constrained to only deal with surface area, then modelling the doors and windows and facade in terms of <strong>Rectangle</strong> is the right level of abstraction instead of modelling them as Door, Window, and Facade respectively.</p>

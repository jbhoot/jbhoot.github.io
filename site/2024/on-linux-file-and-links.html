<h1>A mental model for Linux file, hard and soft links</h1>

<p class="e-summary">I always felt bothered about my superficial understanding of inode, hard and soft links in Linux. Here I attempt to structure my learnings into a simplified mental model. Corrections are welcome.</p>

<div class="toc"></div>

<div class="e-content">

<h2 id="what-is-a-file-in-linux">What makes a file in Linux?</h2>

<p>At the storage level, a file is, of course, a data block. There is more to it than just that, but I won't delve deep into it.</p>

<p>At the filesystem level, a file is represented by an abstraction called <i>inode</i>. Think of inode as a data structure that stores metadata about the underlying data block of the file.</p>

<p>An inode is made accessible with a <i>filename</i>, which is, crudely put, a pair of <i>absolute filename and a pointer to inode.</i>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/file-structure.svg">
    <figcaption>Components of a file. From bottom up, data block, inode, and filename</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Roughly, <i>file = filename + inode + data block</i>.</p>

<p>So, when you say a file, you may be referring to any or all of these components.</p>

<h2>Hard links</h2>

<p>Now, the data block of a file is represented by exactly one inode at the filesystem level. But, if we think of filenames as labels slapped on inodes, then we can refer to the same inode with different labels.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/hard-links.svg">
    <figcaption>Two filenames <code>/tmp/filename1</code> and <code>/home/bhoot/filename2</code> point to the same inode, thus representing two hard links</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the above figure, <code>filename1</code> and <code>filename2</code> point to the same inode. These two are <i>hard links</i>. A <dfn>hard link</dfn> connects a filename with an inode.</p>

<p>The above figure can be interpreted in several ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Given that a filename is represented as a pair of its absolute name and a pointer to an inode, a hard link is maintained in the <i>filename</i>&apos;s implementation data structure.</p></li>

<li><p>Extending the above point, a hard link points a filename to an inode. Thus, the filename is aware of the inode, but the inode is not aware of the filename.</p></li>

<li><p>At this level of abstraction, is it possible to tell which one of them originally created the file? I think not. Hard links are supposed to be equal in status to each other.</p></li>

<li><p>As a corollary to the above point, <strong>there is always at least one hard link attached to a file</strong>. When you create a file, say, with <code>touch filename</code>, you create a hard link between <code>filename</code> and the file's inode.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Deleting a hard link</h3>

<p>Refer to the figure above. If you do <code>rm /tmp/filename1</code>, what should happen from a sane perspective?</p>

<p>Should the entire <i>filename1 + inode + data block</i> combo be removed? Then what happens to <code>/home/bhoot/filename2</code>?</p>

<p>The right way would be to preserve the integrity of <code>/home/bhoot/filename2</code> while deleting <code>/tmp/filename1</code>.</p>

<p>That's what happens when you delete a file - the (hard) link between that <em>specific</em> filename and the inode is removed.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>mv f1 f2</code> creates a new hard link <code>f2</code> & deletes the old hard link <code>f1</code>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/hard-link-rm.svg">
    <figcaption>Representation of one of the two hard links, linked to the same node, being removed. Only the affected filename is removed. The inode and underlying data block stay in tact.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What happens when all the hard links to a file are deleted? Now, there are no filenames in the filesystem that refer to that data block anymore. Thus, the inode is marked for deletion, and the associated data block is orphaned.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/hard-link-rm-all.svg">
    <figcaption>When all the hard links to an inode are removed, the entire file, along with its content, is removed from the filesystem.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Soft links</h2>

<p>Take a look at the following figure.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/soft-links.svg">
    <figcaption>A regular file <code>/home/bhoot/filename2</code> on the left-hand side. A soft link file <code>filename3</code> on the right-hand side. The link file points to the regular file. Both the regular and link files have their own inode and their own data block.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The above figure shows a soft link in blue colour (its blue, right?) pointing from the link file <code>filename3</code> to the target file <code>filename2</code>. A <dfn>soft link</dfn> or a <dfn>symbolic link</dfn> points a link file to a target filename. The link file, which stores the connection, points to the target filename.</p>

<p><strong>A soft link links a link file to a target filename. This is in contrast to a hard link, which links a filename to an inode.</strong></p>

<aside>
<p>In the man page of the POSIX <code>ln</code>, the syntax description goes as: <code>ln [-s] source target</code>, where the <dfn>source</dfn> is the file to be linked to, while the <dfn>target</dfn> is the new link file to be created. These designations may make sense within the specific context of creating a soft link. But, once a soft link is already created, calling it <i>target</i> doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>I prefer the terms used in the man page of the GNU <code>ln</code>: <code>ln [-s] target link_name</code>, where <dfn>target</dfn> is the file to be pointed towards, while <dfn>link_name</dfn> is the new link file.</p>
</aside>

<h3>A soft link file is still a file</h3>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="#what-is-a-file-in-linux">What is a file in Linux?</a> section, a filename is always linked to an <i>inode + data block</i>. This is true in case of a soft link, too. In the above figure, the soft link file <code>filename3</code>, which points to <code>filename2</code>, also has its own inode & a data block.</p>

<p>You can check the inode number associated with a filename with <code>ls -i</code> command. <strong>Two hard link files pointing to the same inode will print the same inode number, while a soft link file and its target file will print different inode numbers.</strong></p>

<pre><code># create a regular file
$ echo "HELLO WORLD HOW ARE YOU?" > file.txt

# create a hard link
$ ln file.txt hardlink.txt

# both hard links refer to the same inode
$ ls -i file.txt hardlink.txt 
<samp>17751620 file.txt  17751620 hardlink.txt</samp>

# create a soft link
$ ln -s file.txt softlink.txt

# inode of soft link file is different from the target file
$ ls -i file.txt softlink.txt 
<samp>17751620 file.txt  17751663 softlink.txt</samp>
</code></pre>

<h3>Contents of a soft link file</h3>

<p>A hard link relationship is stored inside the <i>filename</i>&apos;s data structure, as a pointer to the inode.</p>

<p>How is a soft link relationship stored? In the <em>data block of the soft link file</em>. <strong>The content of a soft link is the filename of the target file it points to</strong>.</p>

Otherwise, the absolute filename of the target file is stored.</p></del>

<p><time datetime="2024-11-10T04:24:12Z">10th of November, 2024:</time> <a href="https://lobste.rs/~kosayoda">Kosayoda on lobste.rs</a> politely pointed out that my struck-out claim above is bullshit. After a few tests, I concur.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/e62p4b/mental_model_for_linux_file_hard_soft#c_gfp3ws">full explanation</a>, but a concise summary is: <code>ln -s some-file.txt link-file.txt</code> simply creates a <code>link-file.txt</code> file, the content of which is <code>some-file.txt</code>.</p>
</aside>
    
<p>There are 2 ways to verify this:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><code>readlink filename3</code> prints the content of the soft link <code>filename3</code>, which is the name of the target filename.</p>

<pre><code>$ readlink filename3</code>
<samp>/home/bhoot/filename2</samp></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p><code>stat --format="%s" filename3</code> prints the size of <code>filename3</code>, which is equal to the number of characters in the name of <code>/home/bhoot/filename2</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ stat --format="%s" filename3</code>
<samp>21</samp></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>I/O operations on a soft link file</h3>

<h4>Copying a soft link file</h4>

<p>What happens when you copy a soft link file? Same thing as when a regular file is copied. Or so I thought.</p>

<pre><code># create a regular file
$ echo "HELLO WORLD HOW ARE YOU?" > file.txt

# check the content size of target file
$ stat --format="%s" file.txt
<samp>25</samp>

# create a soft link
$ ln -s file.txt softlink.txt

# check the size of the soft link file
$ stat --format="%s" softlink.txt
<samp>8</samp>

# copy the soft link file
$ cp softlink.txt softlink2.txt

# check the size of the new soft link file, which should be equal to the soft link file
$ stat --format="%s" softlink2.txt
<samp>25</samp> # WAT?
</code></pre>

<p>What happened there? The <code>cp</code> command simply copied the target file instead of the link file.</p>

<p><strong>My guess is that when those I/O operations, which involve acting on the <em>data block</em> of a file, are ran on a soft link file, they are actually executed on the target file that the soft link file is pointed to.</strong></p>

<p>Thus, <code>cp softlink.txt softlink2.txt</code> would actually copy the target file. Similarly, <code>cat softlink.txt</code> would print the content of the target file. But, <code>mv</code>, which does not need to act on the underlying data block of a file, would just operate on the soft link file itself.</p>

<h4>Moving a soft link file</h4>

<p>What happens when you move a soft link file? This is more predictable. Thankfully, the same as what happens when a regular file is moved - The old filename entry is removed. The new filename entry is created, while the old filename entry is removed. Because the new filename still points to the same old inode + data block, it also points to the same target file.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/soft-link-mv.svg">
    <figcaption>Moving a soft link file replaces the old soft link filename with a new one. The new filename keeps pointing to the same target file.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Moving the target file</h3>

<p>A more interesting question worth pondering: what happens when the <em>target</em> file is moved or deleted? Let's go with a case of severe deletion.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/on-linux-file-and-links/soft-link-rm-pointee.svg">
    <figcaption>Moving or deleting a <em>target</em> file is a more disruptive operation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A soft link file depends on its content to determine which file it points to. Even when the target file is deleted, the content of soft link file doesn&apos;t change, i.e., it still keeps pointing to the now deleted target file. With its purpose existing no more, the soft link thus becomes a dangling, dead link.</p>

<h2>In closing</h2>

<p>From the perspective of structural existence, hard links actually look softer than soft links to me.</p>

<p>Also, I'm cursing my 8-hours old self for thinking that I could wrap up this post and get it out in 3 to 4 hours.</p>

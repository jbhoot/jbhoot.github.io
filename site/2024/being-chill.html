<h1>Being chill</h1>

<p class="e-summary">Being chill is the <em>opposite</em> of being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski">The Dude</a>.</p>

<div class="e-content">
<p>One component of being a chill person is pretty clear: Let go of what you can&apos;t control.</p>

<p>But, to me, the other component is more important, which also gets overlooked: Don&apos;t ignore what you <em>can</em> control. Get it done.</p>

<p>The anxiety, the stress and the guilt that piles up from ignoring the latter is more formidable and <em>insidious</em> than not being able to practise the former.</p>

<p>When I ensure that I get done what I <em>can</em> control, then that sense of accomplishment also helps me put myself at ease about what I can&apos;t control.</p>

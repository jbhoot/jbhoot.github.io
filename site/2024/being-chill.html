<h1>Being chill</h1>

<p class="e-summary">Being a chill dude is the exact <em>opposite</em> of being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski">The Dude</a>.</p>

<div class="e-content">
<p>One guiding principle to be a chill person is pretty clear to most people: Let go of what you can&apos;t control.</p>

<p>But, to me, another principle is more important, which also gets overlooked: Don&apos;t ignore what you <em>can</em> control. Get it done.</p>

<p>The anxiety, the stress and the guilt that piles up from ignoring the latter is more formidable and <em>insidious</em> than not being able to practise the former.</p>

<p>Not doing anything about which you can do something can make you more anxious than not being able to do something about which you can&apos;t do anything.</p>

<p>Update on<time datetime="2024-12-13">13th December 2024</time>: I thin k that the virtues of patience and perseverance fit somewhere within the get-it-done component. Patience probably also fits in the let-it-go component.</p>

<h2>Personal experience</h2>

<p>Procrastinators among the readers of this post, which is me, must have felt hard about the second principle.</p>

<p>My wife is an avid 'get-it-done' person, but frets about stuff out of her control, or which lie in the past or the future.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I am an avid 'will-get-it-done' person, but don&apos;t give a shit about what I can&apos;t control.</p>

<p>Truly, a pair made in heaven!</p>

<p>When I ensure that I get done what I <em>can</em> control, then that sense of accomplishment also helps me put myself at ease about what I can&apos;t control.</p>

<h3>In closing</h3>

<p>Being chill is a lot of work! There are days I just prefer to scream and flail around.</p>

Why does one vote per person exist after all? So that each person can cast their vote for a selfish reason - for something that they believe is going to improve things that matter to them.

To expect a person to cast a vote for the greater good is a misplaced expectation. Especially when you expect that from a vulnerable person.

Role of empathy as the foundational emotion in a democracy

Politicians have a very handy tool to grab power - otherising a minority community, or immigrants. It works well especially when the populace is facing socioeconomic hardships of some sort.

I wouldn't really fault vulnerable people who get convinced by this rhetoric.

I have no rationale to justify the attitude of those who live a cushioned life, but still get convinced by the otherising rhetoric, except that they lack the basest form of empathy.

In such an environment, I don't think the role of empathy is to make a person sacrifice their vote to benefit an oppressed community. Rather, its role should be to enable a person to identify the bullshitter spewed by demagogues, and at least decide to *not* vote for them. They could still vote for their own benefits.

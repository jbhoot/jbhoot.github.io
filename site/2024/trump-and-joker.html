<h1>The trumping joke</h1>

<div class="e-content">
<p>I was always skeptical about how the <i>Joker</i> takes over the <i>Mob</i> in <cite>The Dark Knight</cite>.</p>

<p>The Mob looked too powerful, too entrenched for that to happen.</p>

<p>But they bent over.</p>

<p>Then, in the real world, Trump came along, took control of the GOP, and then of the whole country. Twice.</p>

<p>The old guard of the GOP looked too powerful, too entrenched for that to happen.</p>

<p>But they bent over.</p>

<p>Both of them whisked away enough followers from the old guard, converted them into fanatics, loyal to their tall claims.</p>

<p>For every piece of ridiculous fiction, there is a reality out there that outmatches it.</p>

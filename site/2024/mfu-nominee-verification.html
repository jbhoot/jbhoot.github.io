<h1>Stubborn pop-up on <i>Mutual Fund Utilities (MFU)</i> website</h1> 



<div class="e-content">

<p>Tip for Mutual Fund Utilities (MFU) users:</p>

<p>While transacting for a new folio, if you are stuck at "Nominee Verify" pop-up even after verifying the nominee(s), then check that:
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Whether there are multiple holders of that CAN</li>
    <li>Whether *all* of the holders have verified the nominee(s)</li>
  </ol>

  <img src="/static/images/mfu-nominee-verification-bug-fix.png" alt="Screenshot of Nominee Details section in Account Profile, showing whether some or all of the holders of a selected CAN account have verified the nominee details. All holders must have verified the nominee details in order to be able to transact for a new folio.">

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I forgot to take screenshots, but here is a close enough description.</p>

<p>If none of the holders have verified the nominee details, then MFU's interface in this section provides a "Verify nominee" button *only* for the primary holder.</p>

<p>Once a primary holder has verified the nominee details, the interface looks like the verification is already complete. But New Folio transaction will still ask you to Verify Nominee. Very frustrating.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>In order for any holders to verify nominee details, use this link: <a href="https://mfuonline.com/CNOMV">https://mfuonline.com/CNOMV</a></p>

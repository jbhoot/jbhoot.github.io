<h1>Connecting to MySQL running on NixOS on local network</h1>

<p class="e-summary">I have a Linux workstation, and a Macbook. While I prefer to work on Linux, I also like the mobility around my house. Once, I needed to access a database instance running on the Linux workstation from my MacBook. My first instinct was to sell it all and buy a Linux-operated ThinkPad! After I placated myself, I came up with the following setup.</em>.</p>

<div class="toc"></div>

<div class="e-content">

<h2>The big picture</h2>

<p>This setup aims to allow connections to a MySQL database hosted on my NixOS workstation, <em>only on local network</em>.</p>

<p>I needed to configure MySQL to listen to connections on network interfaces. I also needed a MySQL user who is authorised to connect from a host on local network. Then, I needed to configure NixOS to open up the port used by MySQL.</p>

<h2>Configure MySQL to listen to remote connections</h2>

<p>NixOS features a service to configure MySQL, including the ability to configure MySQL's <code>my.cnf</code>. So it took only a few lines to get MySQL up and running.</p>

<pre><code># in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
services.mysql = {
  enable = true;

  package = pkgs.mysql84;

  configFile = pkgs.writeText "my.cnf" ''
  [mysqld]
  skip-networking=OFF

  # listen for connections on all network interfaces, though
  # only one interface at firewall level will be opened up.
  bind-address=0.0.0.0
  '';
};        
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure a remote-enabled MySQL user</h3>

<p>I wanted to allow only connections from local network.</p>

<p>A default command <code>CREATE USER 'bhoot';</code> would create a user which could connect from any remote host.</p>

<p><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/account-names.html">MySQL follows</a> a <code>username@hostname</code> convention for user accounts, where <code>hostname</code> can use a <code>host_ip/netmask</code> syntax to allow connections only from the local network.</p>

<pre><code>
# as root MySQL user
mysql> CREATE USER 'bhoot'@'192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password';
mysql> GRANT ALL ON my_schema.* to 'bhoot'@'192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0';
</code></pre>

<h2>Configure NixOS to open up MySQL port</h2>

<p>NixOS enables a firewall by default.</p>

<p>I was under the (borrowed) impression that NixOS automatically opens up the ports for enabled services. But that wasn't the case, at least for MySQL.</p>

<p>Opening up the MySQL port was a matter of a single line:</p>

<pre><code># in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
networking.firewall.enable = true;
# Open MySQL port, only on the wireless network interface.
networking.firewall.interfaces.wlp0s20f3.allowedTCPPorts = [ 3306 ];</code></pre>

<p>Then, rebuild NixOS.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .</code></pre>

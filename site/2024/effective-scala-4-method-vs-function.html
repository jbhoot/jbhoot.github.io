<p>A function is a value in Scala, while a method is not. So the former can be passed as a parameter of a function or a method, and can be returned as a value. Method cannot do any of those.</p>

<p>A function is a value in Scala. All values are objects in Scala. An object can have methods. So a function in Scala can have methods.</p>

<p>Any function in Scala has a default <code>apply</code> method. <code>inc(1)</code> is a shorthand for <code>inc.apply(1)</code>.</p>

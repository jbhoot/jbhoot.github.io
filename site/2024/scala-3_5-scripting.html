<h1>Scripting with Scala</h1>

<div class="e-content">
<p>Scala 3.5's CLI now makes scripting with scala seamless! Just a single-file script setup!</p>

<p>For example, due to the single-file scripting nature imparted by <i>Scala 3.5 CLI</i>, I was able to embed a Scala script in a <i>node.js</i> project to analyse parsing of a geometric Point stored in <i>MySQL 8</i>. The script is <a href="https://github.com/jbhoot/poc-buggy-geographic-point-parsing-by-node-mysql2/blob/main/jdbc-analysis/main.scala">hosted on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>With Scala 3.5, plus a built-in watcher, and a large scala/jvm ecosystem, Scala has become a good alternative for scripting.</p>

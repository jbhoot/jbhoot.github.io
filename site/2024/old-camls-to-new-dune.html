      Moved my years old OCaml projects to the new workflow with the
      <a href="https://dune.ci.dev">nightly dune dev edition</a>). I had to fill
      up the barebones <code>dune-project</code> file with dependencies in one
      of the projects. Otherwise, everything worked without a hitch!

      Still lots to improve, but from the looks of it, we may not have to deal
      with the dune and opam duo anymore.

They always felt different from each other, but I could never quite put a finger on the difference.

Then it hit me today, while I was watching a British series called [Trying](https://tv.apple.com/in/episode/nikki-and-jason/umc.cmc.2dzdkdvedw0n9h25d49y9lh99?action=playSmartEpisode).

In American shows, the script feels quite...scripted. Every other dialogue in a conversation is written to be a punchline or a one-liner.

British dramas feel more organic â€“ a conversation goes on with (wry, dry) humour sprinkled here and there.

<h1>UX Design Rework #1 - I love VNSGU</h1>

<p class="e-summary">This series is an attempt to learn and practise principles of UX and design by reworking adverts that I find in the real world.</p>

<div class="e-content">

<h2>Original hoarding</h2>

<p>I found this hoarding while passing by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0ZRwFCkfzU&t=25s">university - VNSGU</a>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/static/images/design-rework-1-i-love-vnsgu/original-gate.jpeg">

<figcaption>The hoarding, on the left hand side of the university gate, lays out a vertically laid-out slogan <b>I am in VNSGU</b>, and also sports the VNSGU logo, cradled by the vertical slogan.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Problems in the original</h3>

<ul>
<li>No alignment between anything. Even the starting letters of each word of the vertically written slogan are misaligned.</li>

<li>Lack of focal point. The word <b>am</b> is needlessly highlighted with a colour.</li>

<li>Abysmal contrast between text and background</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rework</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Find a strong <strong>alignment</strong> - between words of the vertically laid-out slogan, as well as between the slogan and the logo.</p> 

<img alt="Iteration 1 - text and logo are have a strong alignment between them" src="/static/images/design-rework-1-i-love-vnsgu/rework-1-alignment.svg">
</li>

<li>
<p>Find a focal point. <strong>Repeat</strong> the colour of the logo in this word to highlight the two most important elements - logo and the word <b>VNSGU</b> </p> 

<img alt="Iteration 2 - important elements are now highlighted through repetition of logo colour" src="/static/images/design-rework-1-i-love-vnsgu/rework-2-repetition.svg">
</li>

<li>
<p>Use a good <strong>contrast</strong> of colour between the text and the background.</p>

<p>I ended up with two variants - the first uses a <strong>complementary</strong> colour set, where the colour of the logo complements the background colour.</p>

<img alt="Final output in complementary colour scheme" src="/static/images/design-rework-1-i-love-vnsgu/rework-complementary-colours.svg">

<p>The other uses a <strong>monochromatic</strong> colour set, where the background colour is set to a tint of the logo colour.</p>

<img alt="Final output in monochromatic colour scheme" src="/static/images/design-rework-1-i-love-vnsgu/rework-monochromatic-colours.svg">

</li>

</ol>

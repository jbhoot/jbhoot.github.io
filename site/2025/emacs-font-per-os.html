<h1>How I configured OS-specific fonts in Emacs</h1>

<div class="e-content">

<p>Here is the <i>Elisp</i> snippet:</p>

<pre><code>(let ((font-value (cond
                   ((eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
                    "Source Code Pro-12:weight=medium")
                   ((eq system-type 'darwin)
                    "Source Code Pro-17:weight=medium"))))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist `(font . ,font-value)))
</code></pre>

<p>Things I learned while creating this snippet:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>system-type</code> variable in Elisp identifies the operating system.</li>

<li>A <i>quote</i> <code>'</code> does not evaluate the entire quoted expression, but a <i>backquote</i> <code>`</code> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backquote.html">allows evaluation of sub-expressions</a> marked with a <i>comma</i> <code>,</code>, inside the quoted expression. Hence, <code>`(font . ,font-value)</code>, where <code>font-value</code> is evaluated to the font value it got in its <i>let binding</i>, before the parent expression is quoted.</li>

<li><p>The syntax to configure font properties. When I last tried Emacs more than 5 years ago (or more), I was stumped by a plethora of solutions on the internet to specify font properties, none of which had worked. Part of why I had abandoned Emacs back then. This time, I was able to figure it out, thanks to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html">official doc that describes the syntax to specify a font</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am sure there is a better way, but I have only recently started tinkering with Emacs and ELisp. I mean I still nest a <i>sexp</i> by manually adding parentheses before and after the <i>sexp</i>, like a caveman!</p>

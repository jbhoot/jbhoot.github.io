- Ideal day breakdown:
  - 8h sleep
  - 2.5h daily chores
  - 1.5h exercise (including travel, if any)
  - 7h work
  - 7h rest
- Within rest:
  - Do or suffer: things that must be done or will have some unpleasant consequences
    - There is usually some mental stress, anxiety, associated with these
    - Ironically, these don't often have a hard deadline/urgency attached to them. They just lay low and creep up on you.
    - eg., buy pepper spray, secondary back up of documents (in resilio sync), pet registration, etc.
  - Life (us): things that need maintenance, planning, and organization
    - eg., buy new headsets; stuff going on at B-904
  - Life (parents and sisters): things that need maintenance, planning, and organization
    - eg., Dad wants to buy new printer; A.C. broke down; plan Alka-Aakash trip; plan Goa trip
  - Life (other loved ones): things that need maintenance, planning, and organization
  - Fulfilment: things of skills and creativity
    - slow progress, but compound payoff
    - this is best made part of routine
    - eg.,
  - Leisure: unplanned, no-deadlines, fun stuff
    - includes socializing, and time spent with Chhavi
    - Alka-Aakash trip does not file under this. That project is all planning and organizing.
    - painting with chhavi
    - reading for leisure
    - TV
  - Notes:
    - No point in getting frustrated. This is life. Most of the time *will be* spent in maintenance mode. Make the best of the leftover time.
    - A category applies to a project, or an independent activity. A project/activity may or may not have tasks under it. A category is not applied to a task.
